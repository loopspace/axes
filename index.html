	<h3>Help</h3>
	<p>
	  This website helps you make sets of axes that you can print
	  and use.
	  You can configure various aspects of the axes, as explained below.
	  When you print the page, you should only get the axes.
	  The configuration pane, and this help panel, will not be
	  printed.
	  The axes themselves are created as SVGs so alternatively you
	  could download the SVGs and import them into a program that
	  understands SVG.
	</p>

	  <h4>Page Setup</h4>
	  <ul>
	    <li><span class="desc">Page Size</span>: The idea is that
	    the axes fit on a page of this size so that you can print
	      them to the size you want, but ...
	    <li><span class="desc">Page Margins</span>: ... it is
	    quite hard to figure out the relationship between how big
	    something is on the screen and whether it will print all
	    on one page (and it appears to be very dependent on the
	    browser).  The "page margins" are subtracted from the page
	    height and width so that if the axes appear on more than
	    one page then you can shrink them slightly to get them on
	    a single page.  This can be an iterative process, so use
	    "Print Preview" or "View as PDF" options in the print
	    dialogue to check before printing.  The units are pixels,
	    which are quite small.  In my experiments, with A4 paper,
	    I found that 5 worked with Firefox while the margin needed
	      to be 36 for Chrome.
	    <li><span class="desc">Borders</span>: This is the space
	    around each set of axes.  If you cut out the axes, this
	      should be the space left around each one.
	    <li><span class="desc">Page Orientation</span>: Whether
	      the page should be portrait or landscape.
	    <li><span class="desc">N-Up</span>: How many sets of axes to
	      display on the page.
	    <li><span class="desc">Number of Axes</span>: How many
	    distinct sets of axes to display on the page.  If this is
	    less than the number of sets of axes to display, the set
	      will repeat as needed.<br>
	      So to get 2 copies of the same axes, set "N-Up" to 2 and
	    "Number of Axes" to 1.  To get 2 sets of axes, but each
	    appearing twice, set "N-Up" to 4 and "Number of Axes" to
	      2.
	    <li><span class="desc">Current Axes</span>: The rest of
	    the options apply to a specific set of axes.  This option
	      controls which set of axes the displayed options apply to.
	  </ul>

	  <h4>Axes Setup</h4>
	  <ul>
	    <li><span class="desc">Font Size</span>: This is the font
	      size for the labels on the axes.
	    <li><span class="desc">Preserve aspect ratio</span>: If
	    this is checked then the two axes have the same scale.  If
	    not, they are scaled independently to best fit the
	      available space.
	    <li><span class="desc">Grid</span>: If this is checked
	      then a grid is shown.
	  </ul>

	  <h4>X/Y Axis</h4>
	  <ul>
	    <li><span class="desc">Minimum</span>: The minimum value
	    on the relevant axis.
	    <li><span class="desc">Maximum</span>: The maximum value
	      on the relevant axis.
	    <li><span class="desc">Marks every</span>: How often to
	      put marks (counting outwards from 0).
	    <li><span class="desc">Labels every</span>: How often to
	      put labels (counting outwards from 0).
	  </ul>

	  As <em>you</em> create the axes, <em>you</em> have the
	  copyright on them.
	  I have the copyright on the code, but it is released under
